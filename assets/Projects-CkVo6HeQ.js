Throughout the process, I researched best practices, explored documentation, and tested different approaches to optimize performance and maintainability. I leveraged various npm libraries to streamline development, from handling animations to improving state management. Vite’s fast build times and React’s component-based structure made iteration seamless, allowing me to focus on user experience and responsiveness. This project became more than just a website—it was a deep dive into modern web development, pushing me to experiment, learn, and build with efficiency.",link:"https://github.com/DiogoPCastelos/websiteReact",tech:["react.svg","js.svg","tailwind.png","html.webp","css.png","bash.png","git.png","node.png","npm.png"],photo:"images/bgweb.jpg"},{id:2,name:"Discord Bot",description:"For a couple of years, I developed Discord bots using the Discord API, JavaScript, Git, and MongoDB, navigating challenges in event-driven programming, scalability, and API limitations. I tackled these issues through extensive research, relying on Discord’s documentation, Stack Overflow, and YouTube tutorials to refine my understanding of asynchronous programming, WebSockets, and command handling. MongoDB played a key role in managing persistent data efficiently, ensuring smooth bot functionality. Debugging was another major hurdle, especially when API updates broke existing features, making Git essential for version control. Through persistence and continuous learning, I honed my skills in API integration, automation, and bot development, ultimately creating more efficient and scalable solutions.",link:"https://github.com/DiogoPCastelos/awardsbot",tech:["js.svg","discord.png","git.png","npm.png","mongo.webp"],photo:"images/discordbg.jpg"},{id:3,name:"ATS-GoogleAPI Integration Handler",description:"Working with Application Tracking Systems (ATS) and the Google API, I developed a handler for GConnection that retrieves applications from an ATS API, sends them to Greenhouse, and logs results in Google Sheets. This automation reduced manual effort while ensuring data accuracy. Extensive API research was crucial to understanding different ATS structures and authentication methods. When documentation was unclear, I directly contacted integration teams for clarification. A key challenge was standardizing candidate data across platforms, which I solved by implementing a flexible transformation layer. The Google Sheets API enabled real-time tracking, ultimately improving efficiency, reducing errors, and streamlining the hiring process.",link:"https://github.com/DiogoPCastelos/ATS-Integration-Google-Sheets-Handler",tech:["js.svg","google.png","node.png","git.png","npm.png"],photo:"images/gconnection.jpg"},{id:4,name:"Assembly examples",description:"Initially, I saw Assembly as just another university subject, but it quickly became a passion. Unlike high-level languages, it required direct manipulation of registers, memory, and CPU instructions, reshaping my understanding of computer architecture. I went beyond coursework, optimizing routines, analyzing disassembled code, and solving problems with minimal instructions. As my expertise grew, I helped classmates grasp complex topics like stack operations and memory management, reinforcing my own knowledge. Though Assembly can seem daunting, I found that patience and hands-on practice revealed its power and elegance, making it one of the most rewarding languages to master.",link:"https://github.com/DiogoPCastelos/Assembly-Examples",tech:["ass.png"],photo:"images/cb.jpg"}],w=()=>{const d="./",l={width:(window.outerWidth>800,300),height:(window.outerWidth>800,500)},m=80,u=80,f=()=>p.reduce((e,o)=>{const r=[];return e[o.id]=o.tech.map(()=>{let t,i,n,a=0;do t=Math.random()*(l.width-m)-l.width/2,i=Math.random()*(l.height-m)-l.height/2,n=r.every(h=>Math.hypot(h.x-t,h.y-i)>u),a++;while(!n&&a<50);return r.push({x:t,y:i}),{x:t,y:i,rotate:Math.random()*90-45}}),e},{}),g=y.useMemo(f,[]);return s.jsx("div",{className:"flex flex-col items-center bg-transparent w-full h-fit justify-center space-y-12",children:p.map(e=>{var o,r;return s.jsxs(c.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:20},animate:{opacity:1,y:0},transition:{duration:1.2,ease:"easeOut"},className:"w-full max-w-4xl p-10 glass-card flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center gap-10 relative",children:[s.jsxs("div",{className:"relative flex-1 max-w-prose z-10",children:[s.jsx("h2",{onClick:()=>window.open(e.link),className:"text-3xl cursor-pointer font-semibold tracking-tight text-white title-hover relative",style:{fontFamily:"Poppins, sans-serif"},children:e.name}),s.jsx("p",{className:"mt-4 text-gray-300 z-[30] leading-relaxed text-lg font-inter relative",style:{fontFamily:"'Inter', sans-serif"},children:e.description}),s.jsx("div",{className:"absolute inset-0 flex md:hidden justify-center items-center",children:(o=g[e.id])==null?void 0:o.map(({x:t,y:i,rotate:n},a)=>s.jsx(c.img,{initial:{opacity:0,scale:.85,x:t,y:i,rotate:n},animate:{opacity:.6,scale:1,x:t,y:i,rotate:n},transition:{duration:1.2,ease:"easeOut"},whileHover:{scale:1.1,rotate:n+5},src:`${d}images/${e.tech[a]}`,alt:e.tech[a].split(".")[0],className:"absolute w-[10vh] h-[10vh] object-contain transition-transform opacity-50 filter blur-xs z-[10]"},a))})]}),s.jsx("div",{className:"relative w-full md:w-1/3 h-[30vh] flex md:justify-center md:items-center hidden md:flex",children:(r=g[e.id])==null?void 0:r.map(({x:t,y:i,rotate:n},a)=>s.jsx(c.img,{initial:{opacity:0,scale:.85,x:t,y:i,rotate:n},animate:{opacity:1,scale:1,x:t,y:i,rotate:n},transition:{duration:1.2,ease:"easeOut"},whileHover:{scale:1.1,rotate:n+5},src:`${d}images/${e.tech[a]}`,alt:e.tech[a].split(".")[0],className:"absolute w-[6vh] h-[6vh] object-contain transition-transform"},a))})]},e.id)})})};export{w as default};
